abstract: "Ref: https://xkcd.com/2054/ \r\n\r\nAs data-driven organizations grow,
  life gets... complicated\r\n\r\n- data pipelines requirements grow\r\n- more data
  sources and sinks are added to the mix\r\n- tasks become dependent on each other
  in complicated ways\r\n- service agreements need to be adhered to and monitored\r\n-
  schedules need to be maintained... \r\n\r\nApache Airflow, initially developed and
  open-sourced by those nice folks at Airbnb, solves these problems and more.\r\n\r\nIn
  this tutorial session, we'll be starting off by getting to grips with Airflow as
  a stand-alone tool, and then we'll see how we can get it to play nice with Django."

It would be useful if attendees were familiar with Django coming into this session. No prior experience with Airflow is needed.

What we'll cover:

-   What Airflow is all about and what kinds of problems you could use it to solve
-   Airflow development setup
-   Getting to grips with Dags and operators
-   Integration with Django
