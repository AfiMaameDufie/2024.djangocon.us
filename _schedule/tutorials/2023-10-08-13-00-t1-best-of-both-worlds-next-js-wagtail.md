abstract: Fully static sites have clear benefits – and limitations. Rather than going
  fully static, let’s use Next.js in combination with a Django/Wagtail API backend,
  so we make the most of both platforms.

In the JavaScript world, a new breed of frameworks are reinventing how websites are built and hosted. With Next.js, you can create sites that are both static and dynamic across different routes, rendered client-side and server-side, all with one framework.

You don’t have to switch over fully to JavaScript to benefit from those innovations. In this workshop, we’ll combine Next.js with Wagtail, a tried-and-tested CMS based on Django. We’ll get the best of both worlds: the delight of Python in the backend for business logic, and the advanced dynamic UIs powered by React.

In this workshop, we will cover:

- Initial project setup for Next.js and Wagtail
- Connecting Next.js to the backend via a GraphQL API
- Implementing common website requirements in this architecture
- Deployment!

Aside from an initial introduction, all steps of the workshop will be hands-on. We expect attendees to come with Node and Python installed on their system, and to already have some experience with Django and JavaScript. No pre-existing knowledge is required for Next.js, React, Wagtail, GraphQL.
