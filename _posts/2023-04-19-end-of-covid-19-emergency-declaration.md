title: End of US COVID-19 emergency declaration
---

Hello folks!

We wanted to remind DjangoCon US 2023 attendees that the
[public health emergency declaration expires on May 11th](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SAP-H.R.-382-H.J.-Res.-7.pdf).
This means that depending on your insurance coverage, you may be responsible for
some or all of the cost of at-home COVID-19 tests. We recommend procuring tests
before that date if you’re able to.

## Where can I find free at-home tests?

If you haven’t received both of your free shipments of tests from the US Postal Service,
[you can still request one](https://store.usps.com/store/results?Ntt=covid&_requestid=377312).
You may also want to check your local clinics, libraries and community centers for free test distribution.

## I have tests that have expired dates, are those still good?

Maybe! The FDA has extended the expiration date for some tests because the shelf life was determined to
be longer than what was originally known. You can find out if your tests are still usable on the [FDA’s
website (the table near the end)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests).

## What if I can’t find affordable tests before DjangoCon US?

No worries on that front! We will be bringing a number of tests to the conference
for folks to use. When you show up, we’ll have you test before being admitted to the
conference. In the event of a positive test,  we will give you early access to the
online platform so you are able to watch the talks from your hotel room.

## Why are you still testing for COVID-19 if the emergency declaration has expired?

We are a global conference and the organizing team has decided that it’s prudent to
take actions against COVID-19 despite the public health emergency declaration ending
prior to the conference. We understand the measures can be inconvenient. We’re doing
this to ensure a healthy, positive conference for all attendees.

## I still have COVID-19 concerns regarding the conference, who do I contact?
