# Getting active at DjangoCon US

Having talks means a lot of time spent not moving while watching talks. It's important to take care of your body as well as your mind, and a good way to do that is to get moving.

If you would like a little social motivation (or an excuse to share your accomplishments), we've created a [Strava group](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1152127) as we had in 2021 and 2022. It's a different group from the last few years, so you'll have to join again even if you joined in previous years.

Once we send invitations to attendees to join the conference Slack instance (invitations will be sent out to ticket holders by Friday, October 14), join the `#outings` channel if you'd like to join or plan a group exercise.

## At the hotel

The [Durham Marriott City Center](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/rducv-durham-marriott-city-center/experiences/) has a fitness center.

At the fitness center, you'll find:

- Cardiovascular Equipment
- Elliptical Machine(s)
- Exercise Bike(s)
- Stair Climber(s)
- Strength Equipment
- Treadmill(s)
- Weight Machines
- Yoga Mats, Medicine Balls, Weight Bench, Water Station

Most of the hotels nearby have a fitness center so make sure you check with your hotel if you're staying elsewhere.

[North/South Greenway](https://www.dprplaymore.org/265/North-South-Greenway) (7.5 miles of paved trail)  

[American Tobacco Trail](https://triangletrails.org/american-tobacco-trail) (22 miles of rails to trails)

If you want something unpaved, [Tecolote Canyon Natural Park & Nature Center](https://www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/parks/osp/tecolote) is about 6 miles from the hotel (10-15 minute drive) and has some stunning scenery with lots of exits (mostly uphill on the way out because it's a canyon) that you can bail out at. Make sure you bring a _lot_ of water. It's great for taking a taxi (or Uber/Lyft) to the nature center on your way in, then hiking for as long as you like, then catching a ride back once you're done without having to hike all the way back.



## Bicycling

There's a lot of quality biking in San Diego. In previous years, several attendees have had luck with [Stay Classy Bike Rentals](https://stayclassybikes.com), although there are several rental services in town.

It's about a 7.25 mile (11.7 km) bike ride from the hotel to the beach. We've made a [GPX export](/static/gpx/marriott-to-beach.gpx) of the path from the hotel to the end of the San Diego River Trail, including navigating around the one gap in the trail, and [back](/static/gpx/beach-to-marriott.gpx). You can use them to help yourself navigate using many smart devices, although neither Apple Fitness nor Google Fit support importing them natively. If your smartwatch/bike computer uses a proprietary format, there's a chance you can use [GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html) to convert to your device's format.

If you're looking for longer rides, there's lots of flat riding [around San Diego Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.662988,-117.1458351,12.5z/data=!5m2!1e4!1e3) and continuing on to Chula Vista, and there are lots of hills [to the northeast of the Marriott](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8058364,-117.07523,13.25z/data=!5m2!1e3!1e4). Build your rides and share them with us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/djangocon).

If you're looking to abandon roads and go do some mountain biking, [Mission Trails Regional Park](https://mtrp.org/trail-maps/) has 65 miles of trails, the majority of which are open to mountain bikers.

If you want gravel riding, you're probably going to need to go up to North County, where local community Gravel Stoke has [charted a few routes](https://www.gravelstoke.com/gravel-cycling-gear-blog/san-diego-gravel-routes).

There are also a few road, mountain, and gravel routes at [Black Mountain Bicycles](https://www.blackmountainbicycles.com/articles/best-san-diego-bike-rides-pg924.htm).

## Swimming

If you feel like open water swimming, the Pacific Ocean is not far away! Keep in mind that average sea surface temperatures are around 65&deg; F (18.3&deg; C), so gear up appropriately.

to pigyback on drews comment: the Town of Cary which is a 20-30 min drive from durham has boat, kayak, etc rentals for $8/hr which is significantly more affordable than the rollingview marina: https://www.carync.gov/recreation-enjoyment/facilities/bond-park-boathouse
