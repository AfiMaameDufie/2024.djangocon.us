I am Abigail Afi Gbadago; a software engineer with a passion for building efficient systems, community building and sharing my experiences through speaking engagements and articles.

I am an open-source contributor, coach, and speaker in communities and organizations such as OSM, Rails Girls Ghana, Everything Open Source, Django Girls Ghana, Python Ghana and PyLadies Ghana events, where I speak on open-source contributions, opportunities and tools.

DjangoCon US is a conference focused on the Django web framework, which is a popular framework(DRF) for building web applications. As a software engineer, attending this conference provides me with valuable insights into the latest trends and techniques for building scalable and efficient web applications.

As a software engineer and a previous Django Girls coach, attending DjangoCon US can also be an opportunity to connect with other women in the tech industry, share experiences including mistakes and lessons I have learned when working with DRF, learn from one another, connect and build relationships.

Attending this conference will also be a valuable way to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the industry, meet potential employers or collaborators, and expand your professional network.

Overall, attending DjangoCon US can provide me with a range of benefits, from learning about the latest developments in the industry to networking with other professionals and building relationships.
